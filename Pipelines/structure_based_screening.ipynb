    "## Task 1: Get query structure from PDB \n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, protein structures can be downloaded from the protein data bank ([PDB](http://www.rcsb.org)), the largest freely available deposition of 3D protein structures. To get a suitable structure, you can either do it programmatically or manually. For an automated way, you can look at the teachopenCADD talktorial [T008:Protein data acquisition: Protein Data Bank](https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd/talktorials/T008_query_pdb.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier for you, you can choose a structure manually. On the website, you can use the upper right search field and search for ‘EGFR’, and a list of matching entries will be given. To refine your search you can, e.g., restrict the results to human only, from X-ray, having a good resolution (< 2Å) and a recent deposition date (>2010). \n",
    "\n",
    "For kinases, more and detailed information is available on the [KLIFS](https://klifs.net/) webpage. Here, you also find additional information about the DFG-loop state of the available structures as well as some quality criteria, such as the number of missing residues.\n",
    "Your task is to choose a suitable EGFR structure for docking. Make sure that your structure is complete (no missing residues) around the active site. To keep it simple, try to select a structure containing only one biological unit. Note down the PDB ID of your structure. Using the example code below, you can retrieve the structure from PDB using the ID.\n",

Is the predicted binding site covering the co-crystallized ligand well? \n",

    "[*optional*] Download the results from DoGSiteScorer. In the zipped archive locate the PDB file of your favorite predicted binding site inside the residues directory. Open the PDB file in a text editor and note down the geometric center and radius of the binding site. You can visualize the identified geometric center and radius from DoGSiteScorer in PyMol with the use of the pseudoatom command. After creating the pseudoatom with the right coordinates, you can display it as a sphere and change the radius accordingly (Tip: Use the sphere_transparency setting to better visualize all components together). Are you confident about the selected parameters or would you adjust them?\n",

This file format is very similar to the PDB format but additionally stores information about atom types and partial charges. Luckily, the OpenBabel package provides functionality for converting between different file formats and calculating partial charges (command: `obabel protein.pdb -O protein.pdbqt --partialcharge gasteiger`). Check if the generated PDBQT files for protein and ligand contain information about the assigned charges for each atom. In theory, we could also use OpenBabel to add hydrogens. However, Protoss already added missing hydrogens considering protein and ligand in complex, which is more accurate than protonating protein and ligand separately."
