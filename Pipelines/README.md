### Introduction

Some information about the **target** we are interested in: 
Epidermal growth factor receptor (**EGFR**, Uniprot ID: [P00533](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00533/entry)) is involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation. Dysregulation is associated with the development of a variety of cancer types including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 

First-generation EGFR inhibitors (gefitinib; 2003 and erlotinib; 2004) bind reversibly to the kinase domain, inhibiting both mutated and wild type EGFR. However, all patients inevitably develop acquired resistance to these agents. Second-generation include the reversible inhibitor lapatinib (2007) and the irreversible inhibitor afatinib (2013). The first third generation inhibitor (osimertinib; 2015) was approved to target the T790M mutation of EGFR. However, the design and identification of novel chemotypes with higher potency is still required.
